# What do I do?
Currently a Business Analytics Student in the National University of Singapore. But I'm a lift person at heart, riding lifts up and down for fun and posting them on YouTube with some commentary.

You can say I am a video content creator of sorts ðŸ˜‰.

# What do I like to do?
Ride the bus to nowhere, take the lift/elevator to the top floor and down, and learn about the world that way.

# How do you find me?
I have a lot of social media links, check them out at the side!
